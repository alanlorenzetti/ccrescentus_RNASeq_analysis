# Transcriptomic analysis of cold stress in Caulobacter crescentus

We evaluated the effect of temperature in Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 using differential expression approaches between two different conditions, 30°C and 10°C.  

This collection of scripts will perform the differential expression analysis and generate results.  

The repository is part of the study conducted by Hugo Libonati de Araújo and Dr. Marilis do Valle Marques.
